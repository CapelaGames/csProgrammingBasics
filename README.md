# Speaking c#

## Introduction

Unity3D uses a programming language called C# (pronouced "See Sharp") for scripting games.

This github was created to keep notes about different aspects of C#, not to teach how to program on its own.

Concepts you need to know when learning C# are layed out in the following text files. 
If you would like to add to these you may make an issue on github (linked above) or create a merge request.
